                What was formerly known as <em>'Twitter'</em> was the vision of founder Elon Musk. Musk imagined a space where people can freely share their thoughts, experiences, lives, and moments in real time. In July 2023, Musk established X Holdings, an organization that absorbed <em>'Twitter'</em> and turned it into X.

            <p>
                It's no secret that <em>'Twitter'</em> started to get used for the wrong reasons.

                By rebranding to X, we hope that users look at our space in a different way. We hope that people are able to share and express their free speech in a way that doesn't tarnish our name, or their own.
