                What was formerly known as <em>'Twitter'</em> was the vision of founder                 
                <span class="inline-flex items-baseline">
                  <img src="path/to/musk headshot.jpeg" alt="" class="self-center w-5 h-5 rounded-full mx-1" />
                  <span>Elon Musk</span>
                </span>
                . Musk imagined a space where people can freely share their thoughts, experiences, lives, and moments in real time. In July 2023, Musk established X Holdings, an organization that absorbed <em>'Twitter'</em> and turned it into X.

            <p>
                It's no secret that <em>'Twitter'</em> started to get used for the wrong reasons.

              <strong>Friends BASHING friends.</strong>

            <p>
              <strong>People ATTACKING others.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              By rebranding to X, we hope that users look at our space in a different way. We hope that people are able to share and express their free speech in a way that doesn't tarnish our name, or their own.
